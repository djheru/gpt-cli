[["0",{"pageContent":"the last time that Donald Trump wanted to go to the Capal it was to lead a violent coup against the duly elected American government you'll remember this is when he supposedly had a tantrum in the presidential limousine he wanted to go so badly that he got into a physical altercation with the Secret Service over it according to testimony before the January 6 committee now the Secret Service understood that sending the president to lead an armed Riot would present something of a safety concern but in some ways more importantly I think they also understood that they could end up in a situation where they were essentially drafted into Service as the armed priorantioxidant that did not happen the secret servers held their ground they didn't let him go but now Donald Trump wants to go to the capital again to continue the project he started on January 6th ending American democracy as we know it part of that includes undermining the department of Justice's investigation into him their attempt to hold him accountable to law so he does not have to go to prison in fact today he filed a motion to dismiss the January 6 case outright against him citing presidential commity he is hoping this motion will make its way to the 63 conservative Supreme Court that he appointed one-third of and that they will find a way to let him off the hook at the very least delay things until after the election that is the play here but if that does not work Donald Trump is publicly floating he could be the next speaker of the house after Republicans fired the last guy for the first time in American history a lot of people have been calling me that speaker all I can say is we'll do whatever is best for for the country and for the Republican Party would you take the job a lot of people have asked me about if I can help them during the process I would do it but we have some great people in the Republican party that could do a great job as speak just a few hours ago Trump told Fox News quote they have asked me if I would take it for a short period of time for the party until they come to a conclusion I'm not doing it because I want to yeah sure I will do it if necessary should they not be able to make their decision I don't know what does that mean who knows look it goes without saying I think that Donald Trump is Speaker of the House the third in line of the presidency or second in line of the presidency uh would be bad for everyone probably disastrous it would be bad for the country bad for American democracy and I think outright dangerous becoming speaker would not automatically absolve Trump of his criminal liability although I think he might have some notion at will so I sincerely hope it does not happen the the fundamental problem of course is that Trump or someone like him is what the Republican base is demanding to some extent Maga voters want their party to be ungovernable you know a lot of this has been stoked by cynical voices in the party and the right-wing media to be fair people that are making a lot of money off this but if you want a perfect illustration of this problem let's just game out what would happen if Trump were to become speaker at the most basic level it appears that though they would have to change the actual house rules because as of now the house rules quite sensibly say that someone who's been indicted for a felony that carries more than two years in prison cannot serve in leadership H the problem is many folks in the Maga movement want Trump for speaker not in spite of his indictments but because of them because Trump matters to them in as much as he can enrage the people they don't like and crucially vandalize desecrate and destroy the institutions they have come to despise the best thing we could do right now is have President Trump on an inim basis return to the nation's capital walk in to the to the the sanctuary of Nancy py think about it for a second how would the established order accept that that's what he's got for you folks that dude in his two shirts in his 4-Hour live stream every day awaiting possibly going to prison remember there were people that invaded the capital and actually defecated in the Halls like basically that's the selling point here there is that a vision of what it would be good a good life would look like a good Society Good Government no that's the vision that's it that's what they got they're not trying to hide their motivations here there's a new poll out today that provides a really incredible case study and and a sort of study and contrast between that Vision the Steve Bannon Vision articulated there and the Democratic party and its base as to how the two parties both in leadership and among the base approach this same issue okay so as you've no doubt heard and has been covered on this program and many others on this network Democratic senator Bob Menendez in New Jersey was indicted on federal charges last month in a stunningly detailed indictment he's been accused of taking bribes to abuse his position as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and provide special favors to the government of Egypt now Senator Mendez has denied the charges he says he will vigorously mount a defense and we should note last time he was indicted by the Department of Justice they did fail to secure conviction so you know that's a good thing to know and of course the senator is due the presumption of innocence in a court of law like all American citizens protected by the Constitution but the presumption of innocent it doesn't provide some like magical immunity in the court of public opinion people are allowed to form opinions about you especially when you are a sitting politician you can't just say well well do process and you can see that in the way the Democratic party has responded to again that very damning indictment of Senator men as at least two dozen democratic Senators have called on Menendez to resign including Cory Booker Junior Democrat from New Jersey Phil Murphy State's Democratic governor has also said Menendez needs to go and then today we got this which is to me fascinating says a lot okay we have the first look at what Democratic primary voters think basically the Democratic base guess what unlike in the Republican Party the indictment has not helped Robert Menendez in fact the indictment has done what you would expect anym environment Menendez is losing badly he's polling at 5% that's the sitting incumbent Democratic senator he's pulling it 5% in a three-way race Andy Kim who's thrown his hat into the ring who's a democratic Congressman New Jersey has 42% and again that's just based on the news sitting Senator indictment Democratic party leadership says the guy's got to go that's how Democratic base voters respond but that's just one of the two gravitational fields that exist in the physics of American politics at the moment there are two different gravitational fields that exist there is one where you get indicted and everything pulls towards your resignation your party calls for you resign voters abandon you then there's another you get indicted on 91 charges and for jurisdictions and the party pushes you towards leadership and increase popularity your poll numbers go up only that but in addition to supporting you for president the party encourages you to run for House of Representatives in the inter room run the House of Representatives and all this ultimately in furtherance of the vile political project you began when you tried to overthrow American democracy you know CLA any moment over the last eight years where there's some little piece of data in the world that just makes me feel like I'm standing on Earth I I feel this sense of like brief relief and when I saw the polling of Mendez today I was like right like again I don't know if he's guilty I I can't say if they're going to prove his case but like yeah it was the the indictment was you know it looked really bad and Democratic Leadership has said this guy's a problem and the voters are like yeah I don't like this and that to me was like right this is how it can work and does work in one portion of American politics yeah this is the way it's supposed to work I mean in one party you have people who want the Norms of ethical Behavior and the respect for the rule of law and frankly the sense that whether he did something legal or not what's in that indictment makes him unattractive to vote for as a United States Senator I mean that's the essence here that's the essence here on the other hand you've got a guy indicted as you say 91 felony counts and his party wants to bring him back to the capital and have him in charge of the only part of government they control I mean honestly Chris this is a break the glass moment because if there aren't enough Republicans that stand up and say come on folks really are we really gonna go down if there's not I mean all those guys that won and women that won Biden districts they're done they are done I mean Jeff will be the new speaker of the house in January of 2025 end of discussion talk about how to win 2024 let Donald Trump back in the capital yes I mean I I tend to agree with you although again always hedge with the fact that the future is uncertain and lots of crazy stuff has happened in the time that I've been uh hosting this television show but yes I mean that that my next question to you was when you think about the vote on the motion to vac right so all the Republicans are mad because it was eight you know it was eight votes right tiny little sliver the cockus and I understand why they're mad I mean you know it that that's that's annoying when you know eight of your colleagues basically blow this thing up the question is the math works the same way in Reverse right it's like the speaker needs to get 217 or 218 depending on I think 27 because there's a few vacancies you know the there there's eight members in the house of Republican caucus who should be able to say no way no we're not voting for Donald Trump or speaker like they've got the same power and the same leverage in the situation it's just a question of whether they're too cowardly to exercise it if it comes to that yeah I I it I want to believe that this is just him looking for another moment uh to be a n um and and I I think it probably is but the fact that they think it's a good idea to tout it um you know independent voters are I I Believe by and large the majority of them will be horrified at this idea and you know I think everybody ought to remember back if Gates's deal was about the deficit you know they controlled government the first two years of Trump's presidential term they controlled everything they didn't do anything on deficit and that was pre-co they did nothing on the deficit they did nothing to bring down spending he believed in running up the debt he didn't do anything to secure the southern border they did nothing on immigration reform so as if this guy was a strong leader that if he just had the levers of power he could deliver on all the things the crazy caucus says they want that would be one thing but we know he can't he didn't even when they controlled all of government so it is um and I know that's a normal analysis not a Crazy Town analysis but it would help these guys if they would look back and see what Trump actually did when he was president forget all the lying just how bad he was at delivering on anything they believed in observers around the world are watching of course what has happened in the United States last few years they've seen a deadly Insurrection sacking of the nation's capital its president impeached twice indicted four times facing trial possibly still poised to take back power the country's Speaker of the House position made vacant by allies of the corrupt ex-president and also the increasing political violence being carried out across the country by his followers you can understand they quite understandably worry about the stability of this country and what that means for the world Michael besaw's NBC News presidential historian and he joins me now um Michael you know one thing I always try to tell myself when I try to get too presentist uh is that you know the the the US has been through periods of pretty intense uh uh political violence obviously the Civil War and the political violence reconstruction but um in the 1920s uh during the 1960s so I want to put things in a historical perspective I'm curious where you sort of see us right now in that sense well it's a violent country it's not the only thing to know about America but just as you're saying slavery was continuous violence for centuries violence against Native Americans and just as you're saying the Civil War in Jim Crowe and also in the early 1960s for instance after John Kennedy sent a big Civil Rights bill to Congress if you look at his FBI Files the number of death threats against President Kennedy Rose 199s you know the violence against the federal government both threatened and actual Oklahoma City the bombing of the building other domestic terrorist threatening but the difference between that time and this time is this in the 1990s for instance when those threats were there when the actual tragedy of Oklahoma City happened in 1995 we could rely on the president of the United States both parties in Congress and across the country to say that violence of this kind is outside the American system and has to be stopped peace has to be restored now we're in a situation where many more guns in America uh gun safety laws have been relaxed and you've got one of the two parties the Republican Party absolutely seduced by Donald Trump who loves violence who when he was president threatened to you know invoke the uh Insurrection act or martial law to stop violence this is now in the heart of America not On The Fringe yeah and that point about you might call organic political violence by uh you know certain factions and and it might be quite sophisticated or or deadly in the case of Oklahoma City City Bombing sure but but that is the difference that the the person who is the the the nominee likely to be the nominee one of the two major parties the leader of that party his countenancing of it his encouraging I mean one of the most chilling moments I didn't even mention it but I want to bring it up here and we're not going to play it because it's actually too despicable to do so but he was in that room in California at a fundrais and he made a joke about speaker Pelosi's husband who was you know savagely attacked and you know an 80-year-old man in his home he says how's he doing and the crowd Roars and that to me the message that sends to anyone that wants to do something horrible is that he's got your back that he approves of it and that to me seems really pretty unique and uniquely dangerous that's it and in modern times when did we ever hear a president or an ex-president ever say something remotely like that and people applaud and it gets normalized Plus in modern times you know de domestic terrorists and people like the one that assaulted Paul Pelosi perhaps you know these people can now contact each other on the dark web they couldn't do that in Jim Crow Alabama in 1925 this is a very new period and so if you get a possible next president of the United States if Donald Trump is elected 13 months from today exactly or if someone like Jim Jordan become speaker of the house just as you were saying earlier Chris where was he on January 6th why can't he remember what kind of conversations he had or did not have with Donald Trump at a time that Donald Trump may have been running that whole operation to W A couet and Conquer Congress you know one-third of our Supreme Court was a appointed by Donald Trump uh we're not in a situation that we might have been in let's say in the 90s where we could depend on all three branches of our government to protect us against this kind of violence yeah and there's there's also the the question of federal law enforcement and what they do about it and obviously this is a longstanding question I mean you have you know huge attacks against federal law enforcement the '90s and and and and you know what happened at Waco and Ruby Ridge providing sure uh inspiration for folks like Timothy McVey and of course a very tortured and complicated Legacy of how the FBI has dealt with this right I mean you know incredibly uh despicable acts in coil Pro and and and things they did in the Red Scare uh but but also going after the clan in the South you've got the situation now where the FBI is seen as the Deep State and any motions they start to make to try to deal with this is immediately subject to a political backlash of Congress and on Fox News and what has Donald Trump said he has said flat out elect me president I will neutralize the FBI which is a malign organization I'll do the same thing with the Department of Justice and I will essentially Point Lackey at the Pentagon can I say one more thing Chris please what you were saying at the beginning which was brilliant and trenant we should all pay attention to your warning reminded me a little bit of Franklin Rosevelt who was very aware of vulnerable populations in the United States in the late 19 30s he said privately direct quote he said if a demagogue ever took up anti-semitic violence in America he said there would be more blood running in the streets of New York City than in Berlin you need a president who understands that this potential is there to protect every American against that not to try to encourage it well said Michael BOS thank you very much appreciate it [Music]","metadata":{"source":"GbyLH-KSW8s","description":"Get the latest news and commentary from Chris Hayes weekdays at 8
